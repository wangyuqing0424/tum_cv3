This means that if our detector misses an object in a single frame (due to e.g. occlusion), we will not be able to recover that track, and we will start a new one. \n","\n","To fix this issue, we would like to allow our tracker to maintain tracks that are not matched during data association. We will refer to these tracks as **inactive**. During data association, we will try to match the detected boxes for the current frame to both tracks that are active (i.e. tracks that we were able to match in the previous frame) as well as those that are inactive. Therefore, if a detector misses an object in a frame and the object reappears after a few frames, we will still be able to match it to its corresponding track, instead of creating a new one.\n","\n","In order to adapt our tracker to have this behavior, we will use the `inactive` attribute from the `track` class (see `tracker/tracker.py`. This attribute will be assigned an integer indicating for how many frames a track has remained unmatched. Whenever we are able to match the track `t`, we will set `t.inactive=0` and, naturally, when tracks are initialized, the class constructor sets `inactive=0`. \n","\n","Your job is to maintain the `inactive` attribute of all tracks being kept by tracker so that its value represents the number of frames for which the track has been unmatched. Additionally, we introduce a `patience` parameter. Whenever a track has been inactive for more than `inactive` frames. it will need to be killed.\n","\n","Results should approximately be around:\n","\n","```\n","          IDF1   IDP   IDR  Rcll  Prcn

This can be problematic whenever appearance alone may not discriminative, and it'd be best to also take into account object position and size attributes. Secondly, our tracker can only account for pairwise similarities among objects. Ideally, we would like it to also consider higher-order information.\n","\n","To address these limitations. We will now build a tracker that will combine both apperance and position information with a Message Passing Neural Network, inspired by the approach presented in [Learning a Neural Solver for Multiple Object Tracking, CVPR 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07515)\n","\n","The overall idea will be to build, for every tracking step, a bipartite graph containing two sets of nodes: past tracks, and detections in the current frame. We will initialize node features with ReID embeddings, and edge features with relative position features and ReID distance. We will use an MPN to refine these edge embeddings. The learning task will be to classify the edge embeddings in this graph, which is equivalent to predicting the entries of our data association similarity matrix.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eVbnOrlPqWRB"},"source":["### Building an MPN for Bipartite Graphs\n","\n","We will first build a Neural Message Passing layer based on the Graph Networks framework introduced in [Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks, arXiv 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261), as explained in the *A More General Framework* slides of [Lecture 5](https://youtu.be/BR3Y5bAz5Dw) (slides 70 to 75).\n","\n","We will be using a bipartite graph, i.e., we will have two sets of nodes $A$ (past tracks), and $B$ (detections), and our set of edges will be $A\\times B$.
